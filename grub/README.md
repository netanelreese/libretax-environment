# LibreTax Environment
## LibreTax ISO Grub Menu
This directory holds the grub menus that will be used on install to specify the host to install. For adding a new host if the host is the only one that performs its specific function, add it to the root menu. If there are multiple hosts that perform similar functions, create a submenu and add the hosts to the submenu. Follow the format in the existing menu.
